If you are experiencing a bug in your own package that relies on atom-ts-transpiler, and you believe
it is caused by files being transpiled incorrectly (or not at all,) please follow the instructions
to install "atom-transpiler-debug-tool" (https://www.npmjs.com/package/atom-transpiler-debug-tool)
as a dev dependency, run it, and copy/paste the output here. Thanks! ^◡^
